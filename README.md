# Discord Bot Custom Mail Manager

I created this Discord Bot to manage emails stored in a cloud database from the contact form on my portfolio.

ðŸ“‘Features:

âœ… Local Email Storage: The bot can fetch emails from the cloud database and store them locally.

âœ… Email Management: It allows me to delete emails, view all emails in a list, and open individual emails to read their content.

âœ… Automated Updates & Notifications: The bot runs on a local machine, starts automatically with the Windows, and checks the cloud database every 30 minutes for new emails. If new emails arrive, it sends me a notification on Discord.

This setup allows me to host the bot on a simple PC without requiring a dedicated server. And manage everything from my Discord Server with simple commands.
